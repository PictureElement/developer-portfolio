## Customization

### Personal logo

The template supports two types of personal logos, a logomark (default) and a logotype.
You can choose either one by commenting the markup of the one type you are not interested in.
The logo-related markup can be found in `index.htm` within the `<header>` tag.

Markup for the Logomark:

`<a data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-duration="700" data-aos-once="true" class="top-bar__logo" href="."><img src="images/logo.png" srcset="images/logo.png 1x, images/logo@2x.png 2x" alt="Personal logo" draggable="false"></a>`

Markup for the Logotype:

`<a data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-duration="700" data-aos-once="true" class="top-bar__logotype" href=".">Olivia</a>`

### Favicon

Visit [this](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) page, upload your desired image and generate your favicon files. Download the files and place them in the root directory of your project, replacing the default ones.

### Google Fonts

The template's default fonts are _Raleway_ (primary), _Montserrat_ (secondary) and _Abril Fatface_ (logotype).

To change the fonts modify the stylesheet link located in `index.html` (within the `<head>` tag) to request your desired web fonts. Ensure to define the new fonts in `sass/developerportfolio.scss` file as well (see _Styling_ section below).

### Styling
